Project Title:AirLine Passenger Prediction
Project Overview:
This project aims to predict the number of airline passengers based on historical data. The dataset has been taken from Kaggle and contains information on the number of airline passengers over time. The goal is to explore the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning and preprocessing the data, and then use the Logistic Regression model for predicting passenger satisfaction. The project also includes various visualizations to represent insights from the data.
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the Airline Passengers Prediction dataset, which typically includes:
        S.No	
        id	
        Gender	
        Customer Type	
        Age	
        Type of Travel	
        Class	
        Flight Distance	
        Inflight wifi service	
        Departure/Arrival time convenient	
        Ease of Online booking	
        Gate location	
        Food and drink	
        Online boarding	
        Seat comfort	
        Inflight entertainment	
        On-board service	
        Leg room service	
        Baggage handling	
        Checkin service	
        Inflight service	
        Cleanliness	
        Departure Delay in Minutes	
        Arrival Delay in Minutes	
        Satisfaction are the following columns given in the dataset.
Steps Followed in This Project:
1.Loading the Dataset:
   In which i have downloaded the two different datset which is for train and test dataset.And i have performed concatenate function for joining those dataset into a single dataframe.Ensured that the dataset was properly formatted and all relevant columns were present.
2.Data Cleaning:
    Handled missing data and duplicate records.
    Corrected data types where necessary (e.g., converting columns to appropriate data types like dates).
    Applied transformations for consistency, such as normalizing or scaling values when needed.
Cleaning Techniques:
.isnull()
.dropna()
    for rows,columns and using hoe function
.fillna()
    filling defautly,using stastical filling,farward and backward filling and using conditions
.astype()
3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Performed an initial analysis to understand the structure of the data.
   Identified trends, seasonality, and outliers in the passenger numbers over time.
   Visualized the data using charts like line plots, histograms, Bar chart and boxplots to identify key patterns.
   Thus the outliers has been presented and it has been detected by using the box plot and it has been fixed by using the IQR method.
4. Data Preprocessing
    Feature engineering: Created new features like the month, year, and other temporal attributes.
    Splitting the data into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the mod.
    Before spliting it into train and test data i have selected the target variables as 'Satisfaction' and features as remaining columns except the target and unique values.
5. Model Selection
     Chose the Logistic Regression model for the prediction task.
     Although Logistic Regression is typically used for classification problems, for simplicity in this case, it has been applied to demonstrate basic modeling techniques on time-series data.
Logistic Regression Model:
      Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes (0 or 1). It estimates the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor variables. In the context of airline passenger prediction, it can be used to classify whether the number of passengers in a given month is "high" or "low" based on historical data.
6. Model Evaluation
     Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.).
     Discussed the challenges of applying a classification algorithm to regression-like tasks and compared it with other models (if applicable).
7. Visualization
     Used various plots like:
     Line graphs to show trends in passenger numbers over time.
     Scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between features.
     Histograms to analyze the distribution of passenger numbers.
8. Results and Insights
    The model’s performance was evaluated, and insights were derived from the predictions.
   The importance of model improvements and exploring other models like decision trees, random forests, or time-series specific models (ARIMA) was discussed.
Technologies Used:
   Python 3
 pandas, numpy – Data handling
 seaborn, matplotlib – Visualization
 scikit-learn – Machine Learning tools
Sample Output:
Accuracy: 85.12%
Confusion Matrix: 
[[30  5]
 [ 7 38]]

           0       0.81      0.86      0.83        35
           1       0.88      0.84      0.86        45

    accuracy                           0.85        80
   macro avg       0.85      0.85      0.85        80
weighted avg       0.85      0.85      0.85        80

Conclusion:
In this project, the main goal was to explore, clean, visualize, and use machine learning for predicting airline passenger numbers. The choice of Logistic Regression was an initial step, and further model exploration (like time series models) could be explored for better performance. The insights drawn from the EDA and model predictions could be beneficial for the airline industry in planning resources and improving operational efficiency.
